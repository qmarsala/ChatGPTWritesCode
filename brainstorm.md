Lets begin our brainstorming session.  My first idea for our game was to generate a random maze and have the player find their way out.  I think this is a good candidate for our game because it should be pretty easy to do with a console application.  Do you have any other ideas for our game?
```
I like the idea of a maze game, it has the potential to be fun and challenging. However, I do have a few other ideas we could consider as well.

Text Adventure Game: We could create a text-based adventure game where the player is presented with a story and they make choices that determine the outcome of the story. This could be a good option because it would allow us to focus on the game narrative and make it as engaging as possible.
Trivia Game: We could create a trivia game where the player is asked a series of questions on a specific topic, such as history, science, or pop culture. This could be a fun way for players to test their knowledge and learn new things.
Number Guessing Game: We could create a number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number within a certain range. This could be a simple yet fun game that would challenge players' logic and problem-solving skills.
What do you think about these ideas? Do you have any other ideas we could consider?
```

I think those are all great ideas.  I have built a number guessing game before though, so I don't think we will do that.  Perhaps we will start with the maze game and try one of the other ideas later.  

What should we call it?
```
Sounds good, let's start with the maze game then. As for the name, we could come up with something simple like "Console Maze". However, if we want to make it more interesting, we could try to come up with a name that's more catchy or reflective of the game concept.

Some ideas for a game name could be:

"Maze Runner Console Edition"
"Escape the Console Maze"
"Console Quest: The Great Escape"
"Labyrinth Console Challenge"
What do you think? Do any of these names sound good or do you have any other ideas for a game name?
