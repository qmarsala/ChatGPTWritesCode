# Console Quest: The Great Escape
This is a collaborative game development project between myself and ChatGPT. The purpose of this project is to create a fun and engaging console-based game that challenges players' logic and problem-solving skills.

## Game Concept
"Console Quest: The Great Escape" is a maze game where the player must find their way out of a randomly generated maze. The maze will be created with different obstacles and challenges, such as dead ends, traps, and locked doors. The player must overcome these obstacles to reach the exit and win the game.

## Project Scope
The project scope will include the development of the "Console Quest: The Great Escape" game itself, including the game engine, game logic, user interface, and game assets such as graphics and sound effects. ChatGPT will be responsible for the majority of the code development, with my assistance in design and implementation details as needed. We will also be responsible for testing and bug-fixing throughout the development process.

## Tools and Technologies
We will use trunk based development for version control, and GitHub for project management. We will use C# as the programming language for the game, and we will use .NET Core as the framework. We will use Visual Studio Code as the code editor. We will ensure that the game is optimized for the console environment and can be played on a variety of consoles.

## Contribution Guidelines
We will maintain clear and consistent communication throughout the development process. We will use Git for version control and GitHub for project management. We will use trunk based development and commit code directly to the main branch. We will ensure that our code is well-documented and adheres to coding standards. We will create a pull request for code reviews and address any issues identified during the review.

## License
We will decide on the appropriate license for our game based on our goals and preferences. We will consider factors such as commercial use, distribution, and modification. We will ensure that the license is appropriate and consistent with the game concept and our goals.

## Conclusion
We are excited to embark on this collaborative "Console Quest: The Great Escape" game development project and create a fun and engaging game that will challenge players' problem-solving skills. We believe that by working together and leveraging our skills and expertise, we can create a high-quality game that will be enjoyed by many.
