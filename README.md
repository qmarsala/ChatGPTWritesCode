# Text-Based RPG
This is a text-based RPG project built with C#. The goal of this project is to create an interactive game where the player can explore a virtual world, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to progress through the game.

As the human collaborator for this project, I will be providing ideas and feedback for the game design and story, while the AI language model, ChatGPT, will be providing guidance on the technical implementation of the game.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have C# installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Microsoft website.

To generate the project, we will be using the dotnet CLI. Here are the commands to create and run a new project:

```
dotnet new console -o TextBasedRPG
cd TextBasedRPG
dotnet run
```
This will create a new console project in a directory called "TextBasedRPG", and then run the project.

## Game Design
The game design will be a collaborative effort between the human collaborator and the AI language model. We will be discussing ideas for the game's story, characters, quests, and other gameplay mechanics, and then working to implement those ideas in the game.

## Technical Implementation
The technical implementation of the game will be the responsibility of the AI language model, ChatGPT. I will be providing ideas for the game design and story, and then ChatGPT will provide guidance on how to implement those ideas using C#.

We will be using version control with Git and GitHub to manage the codebase and collaborate on the project.

## Conclusion
I'm excited to be working on this project with ChatGPT and to see what kind of game we can create together. If you have any questions or feedback on the project, feel free to reach out to us.
