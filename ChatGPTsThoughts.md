earlier I told you to refactor using the command pattern.  do you think that is the best approach?

```
Yes, I think the command pattern would be a good approach to organizing the player's actions in the game.

Using the command pattern, you would create a set of command objects that each represent a player action, such as fishing, woodcutting, etc. Each command object would have a method that implements the specific action associated with that command. The player's input would then be parsed into a command object, and the game would execute that command.

The command pattern is often used in game development because it makes it easier to add new actions and modify existing ones. By encapsulating each action in its own command object, you can add, remove, or modify actions without affecting the rest of the code.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

I played our game and so far it works! very exciting.  However, only the fishing command gives the player any feedback.  How should we tell the player about what is happening in the game?

```
We can provide feedback to the player by printing messages to the console. We can add methods to the TextBasedRPG class to handle this. For example, we could add a DisplayMessage method that takes a string parameter and prints it to the console. We could also add a DisplayPlayerStats method that prints the player's current stats, such as health, level, and skill levels.

Then, in the command implementations, we can call these methods to give feedback to the player. For example, when the player uses a skill, we can print a message indicating what happened, how much experience they gained, and their new skill level. When the player takes damage, we can print a message indicating how much damage they took and their remaining health.
